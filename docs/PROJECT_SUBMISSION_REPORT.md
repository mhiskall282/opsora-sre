## 1. Project Overview & Business Value

The **Opsora SRE Operations Platform** is a production-grade operations management system designed specifically for System Reliability Engineers (SRE) and Support Operations Teams. 

It solves the operational challenge of fragmented shift handovers by offering:
- **Real-Time Daily Shift Board**: A reactive checklist where operators update operational check statuses (`Done` / `Pending`) with required remarks.
- **Immutable Security Audit Trail**: Every user-facing mutation logs actor details, denormalized snapshots, server-captured IP addresses, and JSON state diffs.
- **SRE Monitoring Console**: Live audit log stream, stale check alert banners, category progress bars, and 7-day completion trend charts.
- **Multi-Format Reporting Suite**: Date-range query engine with interactive Chart.js visualizations, CSV export, standalone A4-landscape PDF print layout, and email report dispatch.
- **User Management & Self-Service Settings**: Role-based access control (Admin, Lead, Agent), password reset via tokenized emails, and account settings.

## 2. Role-Based Access Tiers

The system enforces granular role separation:

| Role | Access Level | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Principal Administrator** | Super Admin | Full root platform access, system configuration, tenant provisioning |
| **Administrator** | Tenant Admin | Workspace user management, activity creation, audit monitoring |
| **Team Lead** | Lead | Activity management, shift board oversight, reports & SRE monitoring |
| **Support Agent** | Agent | Shift checklist status updates, remark logging, personal settings |

## 3. Architecture & Technical Design

The application is engineered using an enterprise **4-Tier Architecture**:

1. **Tier 1: Presentation (UI)**: Responsive Blade views, Livewire 3 real-time polling, Tailwind CSS v4 design system, and custom animated splash screen.
2. **Tier 2: Application / HTTP**: Middleware guard stack (`auth`, `EnsureRole`, `VerifyCsrfToken`), Form Request validation, and Controllers.
3. **Tier 3: Business Logic & Services**: Single-responsibility Action classes, `AuditService`, `ReportingService`, and Notifications (`WelcomeNotification`, `AdminPasswordResetNotification`).
4. **Tier 4: Data Persistence**: Eloquent ORM Models with soft-deletes, polymorphic audit morphs, and Render Free PostgreSQL database.
